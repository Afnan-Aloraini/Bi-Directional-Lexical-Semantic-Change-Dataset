Bi-Directional Lexical Semantic Change Dataset for Slang and Standard Usage
📘 Overview
The BD-LSC (Bi-Directional Lexical Semantic Change) dataset is a benchmark resource developed to study lexical semantic change (LSC) in both slang and standard English.
It enables researchers to detect bi-directional meaning shifts — including sense gain, sense loss, and stability — across three time periods:
T1 (1980–1999)
T2 (2000–2009)
T3 (2010–2020)
Unlike existing corpora focused on binary semantic change (change vs. no change), BD-LSC captures multi-directional evolution of word meaning, especially for slang terms that evolve rapidly in online and informal contexts
